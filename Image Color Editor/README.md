#Eclipse IDE 2020.6, Java SE-1.8

This project is for my Multimedia Programming final assignment. I made a basic image color editor which user can insert a photo and then the user can edit its RGB curves and HSB curves and then saves it into a new file.

How to open the project:
1. You must have Eclipse IDE installed (I used Eclipse IDE 2020.6 version)
2. Open the Eclipse
3. Import the folder
4. Run the code
